## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of different features like hashtags, captions, number of followers, and time since posting on the number of likes an Instagram post receives. It utilizes data visualization techniques and machine learning models to derive insights and make predictions.

## Features

- **Word Clouds**: Visual representations of the most frequent hashtags and words in captions.
- **Predictive Model**: A Gradient Boosting Regressor model that predicts the number of likes based on various features.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights derived from the dataset, including distribution of likes, follower count, and posting times.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes details of Instagram posts such as:
- Number of followers
- Number of likes
- Hashtags
- Captions
- Time since posted

Data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
